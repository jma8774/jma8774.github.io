## Future Update
I feel like this website is very outdated compared to my recent Valorant website, so hopefully I can update this website in the future.

## Update 1
First update to the remake of the website consists of improving the Navbar. Scroll up and down or change the window size, go play around with it!

* Responsive Navbar that is different on mobile and on desktop (based on width as well).

* Eases In/Out of the Navbar in the user's viewport when the user scrolls.

## Update 2
Second upate focused on adding in sliding effects for when elements are presented on the user's viewport. Tested on iOS Safari and Desktop Chrome.
* Navbar will slide in when the user loads the site.

* As the user scrolls, elements will slide in once they're in the resolution of the user's viewport.
