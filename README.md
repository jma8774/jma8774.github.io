## Future Update
I feel like this website is very outdated compared to my recent Valorant website, so hopefully I can update this website in the future.

## Update 1
First update to the remake of the website consists of improving the Navbar. Scroll up and down or change the window size, go play around with it!

* Responsive Navbar that is different on mobile and on desktop (based on width as well).

* Eases In/Out when the user scrolls.
