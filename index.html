        Hello and welcome to my GitHub page. My name's Jia Ming Ma and I am currently attending college at the City College of New York.
        I took computer science in Brooklyn Technical High School and eventually fell in love with computer programming and how everything comes together to create apps that you take for granted using everyday.
        And so, I decided to continue being a computer science major even in college and am currently looking for internships in the field.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p class="reveal-right">
        I am currently interested in software development or game development on either Android or on the computer and is open for any entry-level internship.
        Once I get the free time, I am going to commit to making a real game by using Unity's game engine and C# to create it's scripts.
        Other than that, I am also interested in iOS development, blockchains, cryto-currency and cyber security.

      This is my personal Android game called "Fruit Assassin" and the purpose of this game is to reach as high of a score as possible without hitting any of the ducks. You can click on the picture to view the demo.
      <br/> It was coded in Android Studio using Java as the main language and Photoshop was used in the process to create all the pixel elements.

    <br/>
    <div class="reveal-right"> This is a food delivery app called Foodies developed by a group of friends for our Software Engineering class.
          There was a specific set of criteria that each project must fulfill and for me, my job was to create a working map using Google Map API,
          implementing a voice recognition feature, a food bidding system for the delivery person, as well as quality insurance to make sure everyone knows what they're doing because
          it is their first time using Python and working with GUI. We had to do it in a very ugly way.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <iframe width="728" height="409.5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9i7xZ5n21s8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p class="reveal-right">
      The first thing I worked on doing is learning how to use the Google Map API to retrieve relevant information to display, such as the distance from one location to another, the time it would take, etc.
      Once the delivery person completes their delivery, they can rate the customer (one of the criteria) and then the system will update the information.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal-right">
      The second thing I worked on is the bidding system (another criteria), where delivery people will have to compete with others to bid on an order to deliver. I think this is a very dumb
      thing that an app should have but it was required by our professor. I have a timer running down and whenever a new order was placed, it would appear in the list. Each bidding lasts a minute.
    </p>

    <p class="reveal-right">
      The last thing I had to work on was making a voice recognition feature (another criteria), which allows handicapped people to place food orders when using our app. I made a very basic version
      using the SpeechRecognition and PyAudio modules.
    </p>

    </br>
    <p class="reveal">
      After combining everyone's work together and fixing my team's bugs, we presented our project to our professor and received a grade of 92 which was acceptable because some of us are inexperienced with Python.
